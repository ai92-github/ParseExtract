## PDF / Docx Parsing

### When `inline_images = True`

```In the below sample pdf page you can see 3 images of a product with their technical specifications spread across columns and the corresponding output showing how those 3 images were replaced by some image reference id.```

```Now some application like RAG that uses some chunking strategy to create collections of snippets can now have the image reference embedded with the plain text. So while retrieval, the code can parse for such image id ([Image_xx_xx]) and then fetch the image from some storage/db. The image now can be just shown to the user (as product image) or can be added to any LLM that accepts image input, this will enrich the context(if the image has important data) and create better dynamic responses based on the user query as the LLM will have the image along with the textual data.```

(1) Accounting principles generally accepted in the United States ("GAAP").

(2) As adjusted items are described in more detail in Non-GAAP Financial Measures. Beginning in the first quarter of 2023, BlackRock updated the definitions of its non-GAAP financial measures to exclude the impact of market valuation changes on certain deferred cash compensation plans which the Company began economically hedging in 2023.

(3) Total BlackRock stockholders' equity divided by total shares outstanding at September 30 of the respective period-end.

Three Months Ended September 30, 2023 Compared with Three Months Ended September 30, 2022

GAAP. Operating income of $1.6 billion increased $111 million and operating margin of 36.2% increased 80 bps from the three months ended September 30, 2022. Increases in operating income and operating margin reflected higher investment advisory and administration fees (collectively "base fees"), primarily driven by organic base fee growth and the impact of market movements over the past twelve months on average AUM, and higher technology services revenue.

Nonoperating income (expense) less net income (loss) attributable to noncontrolling interests ("NCI") decreased $30 million from the three months ended September 30, 2022, reflecting the impact of $267 million of noncash gains related to BlackRock's strategic minority investment in iCapital Network, Inc. ("iCapital") during 2022, partially offset by higher mark-to-market revaluation of the Company's seed capital portfolio, net of impact of certain hedges, higher gains on private equity co-investment portfolios, and higher interest and dividend income during the three months ended September 30, 2023.

# TECHNICAL DATA

## TERMINOLOGY AND HEAD CALCULATIONS

1.  **CAPACITY (Discharge):** Rate of flow of liquid measured in litres per minute or gallons per minute.
2.  **TOTAL HEAD:** The standard unit for expressing head shall be the metres, thus the head in metres of liquid column = pressure in kg/cm² x 10.
3.  **FRICTIONAL LOSSES:** Resistance by inner surface of pipe and fittings through which liquid is being pumped.
4.  **CAVITATION:** The formation of cavities in a fluid, is a phenomenon involving the appearance and subsequent sudden collapse of vapour bubbles in a flow of fluid.
5.  **SUCTION LIFT (HS):** Is the vertical distance between pump center line and water level.
6.  **DELIVERY HEAD(HD):** Vertical Distance above the pump centreline to the top most point of the delivery.
7.  **N.P.S.H.:** Net Positive Suction Head. It is the pressure in terms of absolute head in meters or feet at a pump suction branch minus vapour pressure of the liquid at its working temperature. It can be simply taken as entry loss at the impeller eye in the case of centrifugal pump.
8.  **VAPOUR PRESSURE:** Can be defined as that pressure which is just necessary to keep a liquid from boiling at a particular given temperature.
9.  **DUTY POINT:** The pump is designed for one point where the maximum pump Eff. / overall Eff is achieved. This point is called Duty Point or operating Point.
10. **PUMP EFF.:** The ratio of the pump output to the pump input
    Thus Pump eff. =  
    $\\frac{(T. Head \\times Discharge) \\text{ in } kW}{Motor Out put \\text{ in } kW} \\times 100$

11. **OVERALL EFF.:** The ratio of the pump output to the motor input
    Thus Overall Eff. =  
    $\\frac{Pump Efficiency \\times Motor Efficiency}{Pump Input} \\times \\frac{Motor Output}{Motor Input} = \\frac{Pump Output}{Motor Input}$

12. **SPECIFIC GRAVITY:** Ratio of wt of given volume of fluid compared to same wt of equal volume of water at std temp & pressure. Specific Gravity of Water is 1.0.If fluid has Specific gravity other than water (1.0) multiply brake horsepower for water by specific gravity of fluid to obtain horsepower required.
13. **VISCOSITY:** Property of Internal Friction of a fluid or resistance to motion of its particles. Measuring a fluid's resistance to flow will give coefficient of viscosity. High viscosity fluids are resistant to flow and appear thick and sluggish. Viscosity is independent of specific gravity and increases with increase in temperature. Viscous fluids tend to reduce the capacity, head and efficiency while increasing the brake horsepower required. Centrifugal Pumps may be used for viscosities upto 1000 1500 SSU. Above this limit Rotary Pumps are used.

## CALCULATION OF TOTAL HEAD

Total Head H of the Pumpset is given by:
(Ref. Sketch)

$H = HS^* + Hd + hfs^* + hfd + HLf + \\frac{Vd^2}{2g}$

\* In case of submersible pumpset HS & hfs = 0

Where

HS = Static suction lift, the difference in level between the center line of pump and the water level in the sump in feet or metres.

Hd = Static Delivery head, the difference in level between the centre line of the pump and the highest point in the delivery line in feet or metres.

hfs = Friction losses in suction pipe line in feet or metres.

hfd = Friction losses in delivery pipe line in feet or metres.

HLf = Total friction losses due to pipe fittings in suction and delivery pipeline in feet or meters, e.g. strainer with foot valve, bends, valves, etc.

$\\frac{Vd^2}{2g}$ = Velocity head of water in the delivery pipe in feet or meters.

Where Vd = Velocity of water in delivery pipe = Discharge / Area of pipe in ft/sec or m/sec.

g = Acceleration due to gravity = 9.81 m/sec² = 32.2 ft/sec²

To calculate the above parameters, the following details are required.
a. Required discharge in LPM or GPM.
b. Size and length of the suction & delivery pipes.
c. Size, type and number of pipe fittings on suction and delivery sides.
d. Variation in water level on suction side.

In working out the above, care has to be taken to see that constant units are used.

It's better to also provide a schema in the prompt so that you know the keys of the json to extract and process further e.g. prompt:

```
extract the product name, product link, image link and price for all the products. The format should be:
[
  {
    "product_name": ,
    "product_link": ,
    "image_link": ,
    "price":
  },
  {
    "product_name": ,
    ...
  },
  ...
]
```
